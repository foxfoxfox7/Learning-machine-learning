### Linear regression
- [Linear regression from scratch](./linear_regression/Linear_regression_from_scratch.pdf) - Using dummy data to showcase how to perform a univariate and multivariate linear regression from scratch with gradient descent as well as the normal equation method. 
- [Predicting health insurance charges](./linear_regression/Health_insurance_charges.pdf) - Taking data on health insurance charges and looking for a pattern in the data to understand how charges were calculated. Then performing a linear regression to be able to make predictions on future charges.

### Logistic regression
- [Logistic regression tutorial](./logistic_regression/Logistic_regression_from_scratch.pdf) - Walking through the theory behind logistic regression, including a demonstration of how to implement it from scratch.
- [Multi-class logistic regression](./logistic_regression/Multi_class_logistic_regression.pdf) - A continuation of previous logistic regression tutorial. Now expanding the model to account for multiple classes.
