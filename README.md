### Linear regression
- [Linear regression from scratch](./linear_regression/Linear_regression_from_scratch.pdf) - Using dummy data to showcase how to perform a univariate and multivariate linear regression from scratch with gradient descent as well as the normal equation method. [notebook](https://github.com/foxfoxfox7/Learning-machine-learning/blob/master/linear_regression/Linear_regression_from_scratch.ipynb) 
- [Predicting health insurance charges](./linear_regression/Health_insurance_charges.pdf) - Taking data on health insurance charges and looking for a pattern in the data to understand how charges were calculated. Then performing a linear regression to be able to make predictions on future charges. [notebook](https://github.com/foxfoxfox7/Learning-machine-learning/blob/master/linear_regression/health_insurance.ipynb)

### Logistic regression
- [Logistic regression tutorial](./logistic_regression/Logistic_regression_from_scratch.pdf) - Walking through the theory behind logistic regression, including a demonstration of how to implement it from scratch. [notebook](https://github.com/foxfoxfox7/Learning-machine-learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/logistic_regression_from_scratch.ipynb)
- [Multi-class logistic regression](./logistic_regression/Multi_class_logistic_regression.pdf) - A continuation of previous logistic regression tutorial. Now expanding the model to account for multiple classes. [notebook](https://github.com/foxfoxfox7/Learning-machine-learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/Multiclass_log_reg.ipynb)
- [Predicting medical appointment no-shows](./logistic_regression/Medical_no_show.pdf) - An exploratory data analysis of why patients don't turn up for medical appointments. Can be used to target reminders to likely no-show-ers and also space out no-show-ers to aleviate doctors overrunning. This analysis deals with unbalanced data and has some interesting feature selection. [notebook](https://github.com/foxfoxfox7/Learning-machine-learning/blob/master/logistic_regression/Medical_noshow_with_logistic_regression.ipynb)
